# Python-learning
This folder contains all the codes and data files needed for modelling done in python
Currently, the dataset used is of a direct marketing campaign done by a Portuguese Banking Institution.
4 different classification algorithms are used to classify the records into whether the client will respond as 'Yes' or 'No' to the phone call made by the marketing department.
The 4 algorithms used are: Artificial Neural Network(ANN), Support Vector Machines(SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes(GNB) and Decision Tree(DT).
The 4 algorithms are compared based on the the following parameters of the predictions, made by models generated, on the same training dataset.
The metrics are: Model Score, Confusion Matrix, and the classification report generated by scikit library in python. A ROC curve is also plotted for each model to compare the models graphically.
